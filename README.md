Machine Learning - CSE574 - 
Repository for the part of the Machine Learning course at the University at Buffalo under Dr. Sargur Srihari.

Python3, SciKit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Keras+TensorFlow, matplotlib and OpenAI gym environment were used.

The projects are:
1. Binary Classification(Logistic Regression) :
This project was to perform binary classification using machine learning. 
The features used for classification of pre-computed images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of
a breast mass. The task was to classify suspected FNA cells to Benign (class 0) or Malignant (class
1) using logistic regression as the classifier. The dataset we used was Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast
Cancer (wdbc.dataset).


2. Multiclass Classification with Neural Network :
This project was to implement neural network and convolutional neural network for the task of classification.
The classification task was that of recognizing an image and identify it as one of ten classes.We used Fashion-MNIST clothing images dataset.


3. Cluster Analysis :
The task of this project was to perform cluster analysis using unsupervised
learning without labeled data. The task was to cluster images and identify them as one of many clusters. We used Fashion-MNIST clothing images dataset.


4. Reinforcement Learning :
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the reinforcement learning task in
which the agent larns to reach its target on a 16(4X4) states environment. The agent was trained for 1000 episodes and its increasing reward was
observed. The agent was able to meet the target at the end.
